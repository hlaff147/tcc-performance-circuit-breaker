\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The microservices architecture has become ubiquitous in organizations building large-scale digital platforms that require continuous availability and accelerated evolution cycles \cite{newman2021}. E-commerce ecosystems and payment processing systems exemplify this movement, demanding flexibility, fault tolerance, and rapid adaptation to variable transaction volumes.

In this study, we focus on \textbf{Perceived Availability}: the proportion of requests that result in either a successful outcome (HTTP 200/201) or a graceful degradation outcome delivered through a fallback (HTTP 202).

While partitioning functionality into independent services facilitates parallel development and selective scalability, this logical independence relies on real-time interactions between services, typically through REST APIs and declarative clients like Spring Cloud OpenFeign. Synchronous communication simplifies implementation and observability but introduces strong temporal coupling: the consumer service remains blocked until the dependent service responds or a timeout occurs \cite{nygard2018}.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

The risk inherent to synchronous communication constitutes the core of this investigation. When a dependent service experiences high latency or intermittent unavailability, the consuming service waits until timeout, keeping threads blocked. With increasing request volume, the thread pool exhausts (\textbf{thread pool starvation}), causing \textbf{cascading failures} that can bring down the entire system.

This problem is transversal across software engineering domains: e-commerce, logistics, healthcare, fintech, streaming, and IoT. Any distributed system relying on synchronous HTTP calls is subject to the risks analyzed here.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}

The Circuit Breaker (CB) pattern emerges as a response to these challenges. To understand its operation, a useful analogy is the \textbf{household electrical fuse box}. Just as a fuse "trips" and cuts off electricity when it detects a dangerous power surge—preventing a fire—the Circuit Breaker in software "trips" when it detects a "failure surge", cutting off requests to a failing service to prevent a system-wide collapse.

Operating as a state machine with three modes—\textbf{Closed}, \textbf{Open}, and \textbf{Half-Open}—the CB monitors calls to dependent services and interrupts new attempts when failure rates exceed configured thresholds. This provides a \textbf{"Fail-Fast"} mechanism: instead of making users wait for long timeouts that will eventually fail anyway (like waiting in a line at a store that is clearly closed), the system immediately returns a response, protecting resources and improving the perceived user experience \cite{fowler2014cb}.

\subsection{Contribution}

Despite extensive literature on microservices and resilience patterns, there is a significant gap regarding \textbf{quantitative experimental studies} demonstrating the actual impact of the Circuit Breaker pattern. Most available documentation is limited to conceptual descriptions or trivial examples.

This paper fills this gap by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implementing} a Proof of Concept (POC) simulating a microservices ecosystem with synchronous dependency, instrumented with Resilience4j;
    \item \textbf{Executing} benchmark campaigns with Docker and k6 to \textbf{empirically measure} throughput, latency (p95), and error rates across controlled scenarios;
    \item \textbf{Comparing} four architectural strategies: Baseline (V1), Circuit Breaker (V2), Retry with exponential backoff (V3), and \textbf{Resilience Composition} (V4), which combines Retry and Circuit Breaker;
    \item \textbf{Providing} rigorous statistical analysis with effect size measures (Cohen's d = 1.078).
\end{enumerate}
